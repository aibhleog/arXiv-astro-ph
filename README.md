# arXiv-astro-ph

playing around with pulling code from arXiv to post new JWST extragalactic papers to slack workspaces


### where taylor is

Okay, so I got the code up and running and integrated into a Slack app that runs on a schedule using DataLab.  Here's the one remaining snag:

* The export.arxiv.org API-friendly website I use to scrape the postings (which I learned existed the hard way 5yrs ago lol, see arXiv-order repository) looks like it's a week behind the real arxiv.org astro-ph new listings?  Which, if so, makes this plan useless unless I want to risk using the real site.

I reached out to the arxiv support to ask why their bot-friendly arxiv website is 1 week behind the real arxiv website.  Once I get clarity on that I can make it live on all Slack workspaces.
